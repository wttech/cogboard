#### Information is a key to success, with **Cogboard** you can gather all the information about project in one place.

##### We designed Cogboard with these principles in mind:
**Easy to use** - comes with a set of ready to use Widgets that can be configured in Web browser.

**Easy to deploy** - works on any machine with `Docker CE` and `JVM`.

**Easy to extend** - creating new Widget is [simple](https://github.com/Cognifide/cogboard/wiki/Widget-development).

**Secure** - all integrations are done on backend.

#### Widgets:
* [Jenkins Job](./widget-jenkins-job)
* [Service Check](./widget-service-check)
* [SonarQube](./widget-sonarqube)

#### Config:
* [Backup](./config-backup)

#### Development:
* [Debugging](./debugging)
* [Widget Development](./widget-development)

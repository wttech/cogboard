## Endpoints setup

##### This configuration will soon be managed fom UI directly

In order to use widgets that communicate with third party software you must first configure endpoints.  
Edit this file `mnt/endpoints.json`.  
Any sensitive data from `endpoints.json` file is never accessible for end-users. Only `id` and `title` can be requested.

## How to run Cogboard in developer mode

To build and run use default task:

```cmd
./gradlew
```

To un-deploy docker stack

```cmd
./gradlew undeployLocal
```

## How to run Cogboard in production ready mode

`TODO`: Design how to setup for production

##### When launched go to [http://localhost](http://localhost) to see your board
